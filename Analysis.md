## Task0:
    - Time Complexity: O(1)
    - Explanation : This code executes one line irrespective of the size of input.

## Task1:
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Explanation : This code iterates over the list of inputs 4 times and adds those elements
    to 4 sets, making it 4n complexity. This adds to 6 individual lines. (4n+6)

## Task2:
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Explanation : This code iterates and stores each phone and time spent  in a list which takes 2n iterations.
    n iterations to find the total time spent by each phone number.
    Finally 6 individual line. So it is 3n.

## Task3:
    - Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
    - Explanation : This code iterates through all the elements in a list which counts to O(n).
    Sort function time complexity is O(nlogn).

## Task4:
    - Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
    - Explanation: This code iterates through all the elements in a list which counts to O(n).
    all the elements in the list are sorted with O(nlogn) complexity.
