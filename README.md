The repository has six codes in python which cover a variety of topics related to the data structures.

## Least Recently Used Cache
The goal will be to design a data structure known as a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit.

##  File Recursion
  The goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with ".c" for the given "Test directory".

## Huffman Coding
A Huffman code is a type of optimal prefix code that is used for compressing data. The Huffman encoding and decoding schema is also lossless, meaning that when compressing the data to make it smaller, there is no loss of information.

The Huffman algorithm works by assigning codes that correspond to the relative frequency of each character for each character. The Huffman code can be of any length and does not require a prefix; therefore, this binary code can be visualized on a binary tree with each encoded character being stored on leafs.

## Active Directory
In Windows Active Directory, a group can consist of user(s) and group(s) themselves. We can construct this hierarchy as such. Where User is represented by str representing their ids.

## Blockchain
A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. For our blockchain we will be using a SHA-256 hash, the Greenwich Mean Time when the block was created, and text strings as the data.

## Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists
The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B.
